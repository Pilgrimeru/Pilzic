## Getting Started üìã

Follow the steps below to set up and run Pilzic. Docker installation is recommended for beginners due to its simplicity and ease of use.

### Option 1: Using Docker üêã (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker:** Version 20.10 or higher. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Discord API Token:** Obtain from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pilgrimeru/Pilzic.git
cd Pilzic
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Rename the example configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp config.env.example config.env
   ```

2. Open `config.env` in a text editor and fill in the necessary values:

   ```env
   TOKEN="your-discord-bot-token" # Your Discord bot token
   MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE=500
   PREFIX="!"
   AUTO_DELETE=true
   LOCALE="en"
   STAY_TIME=30
   AUDIO_QUALITY=0
   DEFAULT_VOLUME=100
   MAIN_COLOR="#69ADC7"
   ```

   > **Note:** You can also pass the `TOKEN` directly via Docker run command, which will override the value in `config.env`.

#### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t pilzic .
```

#### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d --name pilzic \
  --restart=always \
  -e TOKEN="your-discord-bot-token" \
  pilzic
```

- **`-e TOKEN="your-discord-bot-token"`**: Passes the Discord token directly.
- **`--restart=always`**: Ensures the container restarts automatically on system reboot or if it crashes.

#### Step 5: Verify the Bot is Running

Check the logs to ensure the bot started successfully:

```bash
docker logs -f pilzic
```

- **Discord API Token:** Obtain from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
