Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

   cp config.env.example config.env
   ```

2. Open `config.env` in a text editor and fill in the necessary values:

   > **Note:** You can also pass the `TOKEN` or any other directly via Docker run command, which will override the value in `config.env`.

docker build -t pilzic .
